# Wellmentor

## Project discription
Welcome to Wellmentor, a compassionate platform devoted to mental health awereness. Our mission is to offer a secure sanctuary where men can seek insight, support, and guidance in order to raise awareness and braking the stigma about mental health. 
Our innovative survey tool assists users in evaluating their mental well-being, providing personalized results, and tailored guidance based on their test outcomes.
It is proven that screen time and doom scrolling has a negative impact on an individual's mental health. 
Wellmentor does not want the user to spend more time in front of their screen, instead, it makes them realize that they might not feeling as good as they thought. 
Furthermore, it connects the user to a wider community of people and incorages you to break out of your own shell.

## Design concept
The color concept is based around the hero image. It shows a group of climbers ready to climp the Vinicunca, also known as Rainbow Mountain. The mountain symbolizes the challenge ahead of you, whereas the rainbow stands for the calm after the storm, that better times lie ahead. At the bottom of the image, you can see a group of climbers symbolizing that no one is alone.
The color palette has been created with the colors from the hero image. The earth tones convey warmth and calm.
